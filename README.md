# DED Server Information

This is a community collaborative guide to the DED Server program, developed by the CoC Dev Team (not affiliated with Supercell). 

To add pages to this Wiki fork this repository and add `.md` files. These files will be formatted as HTML pages and posted on [cocdevteam.info](http://cocdevteam.info/) when your pull request is merged. Visit the documentation for GH Markdown [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) to learn how to format your pages.

**Note** regarding additional content: If you are adding pages related to **DEDServer**, the pages should be located in the `/ded` directory, not in the root.
